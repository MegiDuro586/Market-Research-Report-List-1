<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ventricular Drainage Tubes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ventricular</li><li>Peritoneal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Ventricular Drainage Tubes market primarily includes two types: ventricular drainage tubes and peritoneal drainage tubes. Ventricular drainage tubes are designed to manage cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by diverting excess fluid from the ventricles of the brain, often used in conditions like hydrocephalus. Peritoneal drainage tubes, on the other hand, are utilized to remove excess fluid from the peritoneal cavity, aiding in conditions such as ascites. Both types play critical roles in alleviating pressure and ensuring proper fluid balance in the body.</p></p>
